# Implementation Plan: TestMemo QA Knowledge Sharing Tool

**Branch**: `001-testmemo-frontend` | **Date**: 2025-10-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-testmemo-frontend/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

TestMemo is a frontend-only QA knowledge sharing tool that enables QA engineers to quickly capture, search, and reuse testing insights without server infrastructure. Primary requirement: rapid memo creation with attachments and local storage persistence. Technical approach: Progressive Web App with client-side search, local storage data management, and offline-first architecture.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ with modern ES2022 features for type safety and developer experience
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18+, Vite 4+ build tool, Tailwind CSS + Headless UI, Dexie.js for IndexedDB
**Storage**: Browser LocalStorage API with IndexedDB for large attachments and structured queries
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library for unit tests, Playwright for integration testing
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
**Project Type**: web - single-page application with offline capabilities
**Performance Goals**: <500ms search response for 1000 memos, <30s memo creation time, <2s application startup
**Constraints**: Offline-first operation, 10MB total storage per user, no server dependencies
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application, ~100 memos per typical user, 5-10 screen components

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Phase 1 Design Complete - Final Constitutional Compliance Review**:

**Specification-First Development**:
- [x] Complete validated specification exists in spec.md
- [x] Specification is technology-agnostic (no languages, frameworks, databases mentioned)
- [x] All functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic

**Independent User Story Delivery**:
- [x] User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3, P4) with clear MVP definition
- [x] Each story can be implemented, tested, and delivered independently
- [x] No cross-story dependencies that break independent delivery
- [x] P1 story represents viable standalone value (basic memo creation)

**Template-Driven Consistency**:
- [x] All artifacts follow standardized templates from .specify/templates/
- [x] Any template deviations are explicitly justified
- [x] Required sections from templates are completed

**Quality Gates and Validation**:
- [x] Specification passed quality validation checklist
- [x] Plan will undergo constitutional compliance review
- [x] Clear validation criteria defined for each development phase

**Simplicity and YAGNI**:
- [x] Feature starts with simplest possible implementation (basic memo storage)
- [x] Any additional complexity is documented in Complexity Tracking section
- [x] Simpler alternatives have been considered and rejection rationale provided

**Post-Design Validation**:
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items resolved through research phase
- [x] Data model supports all functional requirements without over-engineering
- [x] Service contracts define minimal viable interfaces
- [x] Component interfaces promote reusability without premature abstraction
- [x] Technology stack choices justified and documented
- [x] Implementation phases maintain independent deliverability

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure selected for frontend-only implementation. Focus on component-based architecture with clear separation between UI (components), business logic (services), and data types. Testing structure mirrors source organization for maintainability.
