# Research: TestMemo QA Knowledge Sharing Tool

**Feature**: TestMemo frontend-only implementation
**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Complete

## Research Tasks

### 1. Frontend Framework Selection

**Decision**: React 18+ with TypeScript

**Rationale**: 
- React provides excellent component reusability and testing ecosystem
- Strong TypeScript integration for type safety in data models
- Large ecosystem of UI libraries and development tools
- Well-established patterns for local storage management
- Good performance characteristics for single-page applications

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vue 3: Good option but smaller ecosystem for testing tools
- Vanilla TypeScript: Would require building too much infrastructure
- Svelte: Excellent performance but smaller community and tooling ecosystem

### 2. Build Tooling

**Decision**: Vite 4+ as build tool and development server

**Rationale**:
- Fast development server with hot module replacement
- Excellent TypeScript support out of the box
- Modern ES modules approach aligns with browser-native standards
- Small bundle sizes important for offline-first PWA
- Built-in PWA plugin support

**Alternatives considered**:
- Create React App: Deprecated and slower build times
- Webpack: More configuration overhead for simple SPA requirements
- Parcel: Good option but less ecosystem integration

### 3. UI Framework

**Decision**: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI components

**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach enables rapid prototyping
- Small bundle size when purged (important for offline constraints)
- Headless UI provides accessible components without design lock-in
- Easy customization for QA tool-specific needs

**Alternatives considered**:
- Material-UI: Heavy bundle size not suitable for offline-first
- Chakra UI: Good option but less customization flexibility
- Plain CSS: Too much development overhead for UI consistency

### 4. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright

**Rationale**:
- Vitest integrates seamlessly with Vite build system
- React Testing Library promotes user-centric testing approaches
- Playwright provides reliable cross-browser integration testing
- All tools support TypeScript without additional configuration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest: Slower startup and requires additional configuration with Vite
- Cypress: Good option but Playwright has better TypeScript support

### 5. Local Storage Architecture

**Decision**: Layered approach with LocalStorage + IndexedDB

**Rationale**:
- LocalStorage for simple key-value data (settings, tags)
- IndexedDB for structured queries and large attachments
- Provides fallback mechanism if one storage method fails
- Enables efficient search across large memo collections

**Alternatives considered**:
- LocalStorage only: Limited by 5-10MB quota and synchronous API
- IndexedDB only: More complex API for simple data structures
- WebSQL: Deprecated and not suitable for modern browsers

### 6. PWA and Offline Strategy

**Decision**: Service Worker with Cache-First strategy

**Rationale**:
- Cache-first ensures application works completely offline
- Service worker can handle background sync when connection returns
- PWA manifest enables "install" experience on desktop and mobile
- Workbox provides tested patterns for cache management

**Alternatives considered**:
- Network-first: Doesn't align with offline-first requirement
- No PWA: Would not meet offline functionality requirement

## Technology Stack Summary

- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript 5.0+
- **Build Tool**: Vite 4+ with PWA plugin
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI
- **Storage**: LocalStorage + IndexedDB with Dexie.js wrapper
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- **PWA**: Service Worker with Workbox

## Implementation Approach

1. **Phase 1**: Basic memo CRUD with LocalStorage
2. **Phase 2**: Search and filtering with client-side indexing
3. **Phase 3**: Knowledge cards and linking
4. **Phase 4**: Data export/import and PWA features

Each phase delivers independently valuable functionality.
