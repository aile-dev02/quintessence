# Tasks: TestMemo QA Knowledge Sharing Tool

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-testmemo-frontend/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL and not explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root based on plan.md structure
- All paths reference the single-page application structure defined in plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan with React + TypeScript + Vite
- [ ] T002 Initialize Node.js project with package.json and install React 18+, TypeScript 5.0+, Vite 4+ dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure Tailwind CSS and PostCSS in tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js
- [ ] T004 [P] Install and configure testing dependencies (Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright)

- [ ] T008 [P] Configure PWA plugin (vite-plugin-pwa, workbox-window) in vite.config.ts
- [ ] T009 [P] Setup ESLint and Prettier configuration files
- [ ] T010 [P] Create initial directory structure (src/components, src/services, src/types, src/utils)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T011 Create TypeScript type definitions in src/types/index.ts for Memo, Attachment, KnowledgeCard, Project, Tag interfaces
- [ ] T012 [P] Create base LocalStorage service wrapper in src/services/storage/LocalStorageService.ts
- [ ] T013 [P] Create IndexedDB service wrapper using Dexie in src/services/storage/IndexedDBService.ts
- [ ] T014 [P] Create UUID utility functions in src/utils/uuid.ts

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but benefits from US1 memo data
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but integrates with US1 memo editor  
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but works with data from US1-3

### Within Each User Story

- Models and services before UI components
- Core functionality before advanced features
- Basic components before integration
- Validation and error handling after core implementation

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each user story, most component creation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all model creation for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Memo entity model class in src/services/storage/MemoModel.ts"
Task: "Create Attachment entity model class in src/services/storage/AttachmentModel.ts"
Task: "Create Tag utility functions in src/utils/tagUtils.ts"

# Launch all UI components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create MemoEditor component in src/components/memo/MemoEditor.tsx"
Task: "Create AttachmentUploader component in src/components/common/AttachmentUploader.tsx"
Task: "Create MemoCard component in src/components/memo/MemoCard.tsx"
Task: "Create MemoList component in src/components/memo/MemoList.tsx"
Task: "Create TagInput component in src/components/common/TagInput.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo  
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Quick Memo Creation)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Search and Filtering)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Knowledge Cards)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Export/Import)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Frontend-only approach uses local storage extensively
- PWA capabilities enable offline-first functionality
- No server dependencies - all functionality client-side
