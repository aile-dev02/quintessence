# Feature Specification: TestMemo QA Knowledge Sharing Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-testmemo-frontend`  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "TestMemo QAナレッジ共有ツール（フロントエンドのみ実装）"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Memo Creation (Priority: P1)

QA engineers can rapidly create and save test memos with text content, attachments, and automatic tagging during testing sessions. All data is stored locally in the browser without requiring server infrastructure.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - enabling QA engineers to capture insights immediately during testing without losing context or momentum.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a memo with text and attachments, verifying it saves to local storage, and can be retrieved later. Delivers immediate value for individual memo taking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a QA engineer is testing a feature, **When** they click "Quick Memo" and enter text with a screenshot attachment, **Then** the memo is saved locally and appears in their memo list
2. **Given** a user has created a memo, **When** they close and reopen the application, **Then** the memo persists and is displayed with all attachments
3. **Given** a user is creating a memo, **When** they add tags manually or accept AI-suggested tags, **Then** tags are associated with the memo for later filtering

---

### User Story 2 - Local Search and Filtering (Priority: P2)

Users can search through their locally stored memos using text search and filter by tags, date ranges, and project categories to quickly find relevant past information.

**Why this priority**: Search functionality transforms the tool from a simple note-taking app to a knowledge management system, enabling reuse of past insights.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple memos with different tags and content, then verifying search returns appropriate results and filters work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple memos exist with different content, **When** user enters search terms, **Then** memos containing those terms are displayed
2. **Given** memos have various tags, **When** user filters by specific tags, **Then** only memos with those tags are shown
3. **Given** memos from different time periods, **When** user applies date range filter, **Then** only memos within that range appear

---

### User Story 3 - Knowledge Card Management (Priority: P3)

Users can create and manage reusable knowledge cards for common QA procedures, FAQs, and test templates that can be referenced and linked to specific memos.

**Why this priority**: Knowledge cards provide standardization and reusability, but the basic memo functionality must exist first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating knowledge cards, linking them to memos, and verifying they can be referenced and edited independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has identified a common testing pattern, **When** they create a knowledge card with procedures, **Then** the card is saved and can be linked to relevant memos
2. **Given** knowledge cards exist, **When** creating a new memo, **Then** users can select and link relevant cards
3. **Given** a knowledge card needs updating, **When** user edits the card, **Then** changes are reflected in all linked memos

---

### User Story 4 - Data Export and Import (Priority: P4)

Users can export their memo collection to standard formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown) for backup or migration purposes, and import existing data from various formats.

**Why this priority**: Data portability is important for user confidence but not essential for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by exporting memos to file formats and importing them back, verifying data integrity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has created multiple memos, **When** they export to JSON format, **Then** all memo data including attachments are included in the export
2. **Given** user has exported data, **When** they import it on a different browser or device, **Then** all memos are restored with full fidelity
3. **Given** user has CSV data from other tools, **When** they import it, **Then** data is converted to memo format appropriately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when local storage quota is exceeded?
- How does the system handle corrupted local storage data?
- What occurs when user tries to attach very large files?
- How does the application behave when running offline?
- What happens if browser storage is cleared unexpectedly?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST store all memo data locally in browser storage without requiring server connectivity
- **FR-002**: System MUST support text content, multiple file attachments (images, logs, documents), and manual tagging  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to create, edit, delete, and duplicate memos through intuitive interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide full-text search across all memo content and metadata
- **FR-005**: System MUST support filtering by tags, creation date, and project categories
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically generate suggested tags based on memo content using client-side text analysis
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to attach files through drag-and-drop or file selection dialog
- **FR-008**: System MUST display thumbnails for image attachments and file icons for other attachment types
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide CRUD operations for knowledge cards with rich text editing capabilities
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to link knowledge cards to memos and navigate between related items
- **FR-011**: System MUST export data to JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats
- **FR-012**: System MUST import data from JSON and CSV formats with validation
- **FR-013**: System MUST work completely offline after initial page load
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide responsive design for desktop and tablet usage
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle storage quota limits gracefully with user notifications

### Key Entities

- **Memo**: Contains title, body text, attachments array, tags array, project association, creation/modification timestamps, and unique identifier
- **Attachment**: Represents uploaded files with metadata including file name, type, size, and base64 encoded content for local storage
- **Knowledge Card**: Reusable content blocks with title, rich text body, tags, and relationships to memos
- **Tag**: Simple label system for categorization with name and optional color coding
- **Project**: Grouping mechanism for organizing related memos with name and description
